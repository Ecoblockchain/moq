Mountain Observation Quality Control

Matlab scripts for running the quality control methods developed explicitly for mountain observations of irradiances. Specifically targets:

-burial of sensors by snow (MOQ_SOD_Detect.m)

-shading (SW_Obs_QC_PlottingTool_SolGeo.m -- note: this script is not incorporated into master function. Update will be made in future releases)

-other climate based checks (MOQ_LongShiLimits_Graph.m, based on Long and Shi 2008, An Automated Quality Assessment and Control Algorithm for Surface Radiation Measurements)

-master function for running all of these, minus shading (SW_Obs_QC_v2.m)
